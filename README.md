# pokédex

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web application for Pokémon fans featuring Generation 1 (the OG) Pokémon.

### Why I Built This

This solo project was built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to get a good foundation on DOM manipulation, AJAX, working with data from an API, and JSON to store and retrieve data from previous sessions.

Having grown up playing the games and watching the series, I wanted to take a stab at recreating the Pokédex for Generation 1 (the best) Pokémon while adding a little bit of ~spice~.
